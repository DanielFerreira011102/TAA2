    "# Global Ethos: Clustering Countries based on Values and Beliefs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze and cluster countries based on their values and beliefs, using data from the WVS Cross-National Wave 7 (2017-2022) dataset. Focusing on three thematic sub-sections—social values, religious values, and ethical values—we seek to uncover patterns and relationships within and among nations, providing insights into global cultural diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the application of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering and dimensionality reduction, we will group countries based on shared characteristics, revealing clusters and patterns that shed light on cultural similarities and differences across nations. This analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the cultural landscapes shaping societies globally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's outcomes have broad implications for cross-cultural studies, policy-making, and intercultural understanding. Understanding the values and beliefs that underpin different societies can foster empathy, appreciation, and collaboration among nations, promoting a more inclusive and harmonious global society.\n",

    "We have a set of preprocessing methods that can be used to clean and transform data before we can use it for machine learning tasks. First, we have a `split_data` method that takes in a dataset and splits it into input and output components, where the `target_col` parameter specifies which column should be treated as the output variable. Next, we have several encoding methods like `label_encode`, `one_hot_encode`, and `ordinal_encode`, which can be used to transform categorical data into numerical format. The `full_clean` method is a comprehensive method that applies various encoding techniques and feature engineering techniques to a given dataset. Finally, we have the `standard_scale` method, which can be used to normalize data by scaling it to a standard deviation of 1.\n",
